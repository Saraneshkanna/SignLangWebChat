# SignLangWebChat
A website that can connect two hosts via a web chat and is able to stream video with real time hand sign detection by running the input feed through an ML model on the sender side and then broadcasting it to the receiver. Uses Tensorflowâ€™s Object Detection model for determining hand signs and OBS to simulate a virtual webcam that has the video feed with the translation overlay on it.
